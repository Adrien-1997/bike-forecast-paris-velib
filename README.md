# Vélib’ Forecast

This repository contains:

- the **backend** (data pipelines, models, monitoring),
- the **API**,
- and the **UI**.

📚 **Documentation status**

I am currently in the process of documenting the codebase:

- module-level documentation is being added progressively,
- internal READMEs are being written under `service/` (core, jobs, etc.),
- API and UI documentation will be added next.

Expect the documentation structure and content to evolve over the next commits.
